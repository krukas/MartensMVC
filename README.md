MartensMCV
==========

 MartensMCV is an simple and smal framework that make use of OOP and MVC (Model View Controller) patern. 
 It is good for small setup when you start a new projects that give you:

    -Working MVC patern.
    -SEO urls (with .htacces file).
    -MYSQL database library.
    -Other libraries like mail, upload, paginate.
    -Easy to add your own libraries.
    -Auto load function for libraries and models.
    
    
##Why building this framework
You think why build a framework when there are plenty of frameworks avidiable.
It was because when I was looking into CodeIgniter framework, 
it seems fun to build my own small MVC framework to better understand how it works, instead of just using it. 
For me it was an educational project for learning how to apply OOP in PHP and MVC patern.
And i'm sharing the code on github so maybe other people can use it or learn something from it because it is not so big.
